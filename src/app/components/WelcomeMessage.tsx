                      </h2>
                      <p className="message-body">
                        Without a doubt, recent advances in drug delivery, genetic therapies, nanotechnology, AI, and pharmacology have revolutionized disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment over the past century. But, how did this occur? Was your research part of these advancements? Have we innovated and commercialized enough? While some of these wonderful research advances have made it to the market helping real patients, many have not. Are we doing enough to translate Biotechnology research into real products? Are companies not paying attention to this wonderful research? Are Universities not doing enough to help you? Is your research being licensed to Big Biotechnology? Starting new companies? What about federal funding agencies? Are they supporting your commercialization efforts? And, most importantly, are you in the right environment to innovate and commercialize your research?
                      </p>
                      <p className="message-body">
                        Well in my own experience, above all else, it takes a supportive environment. We all have great ideas. But, it takes more than that. It takes a supportive community to translate lab research into commercial products. It takes determination and fortitude to see it through. You need to surround yourself with the right people – and if you are currently not around a supportive optimistic environment, leave ! Leave that negative, ultra-competitive University you are at - I did! Leave that company that is stifling your advances. Attend the right conferences, not those super competitive conferences where the same people give the same talks, and put your work down!
                      </p>

                      <p className="message-body">
                        Once I found a truly supportive environment just 4 years ago, I was able to not only start numerous companies, but commercialize my research into medical devices now in over 30,000 patients with no failures, only success. No infection. No chronic inflammation. No implant loosening. No failures. Period. It just took courage to leave a University which did not care about my research and colleagues who only pushed their own research, constantly putting others down. Negativity everywhere! Once I found the right environment, everything else moved very quickly – including FDA approval and my research advances in patients in just 4 years!
                      </p>

                      <p className="message-body">
                        So I encourage everyone to find that right environment. Attend the right conferences: Biotechnology Conference 2026 at the heart of innovation and commercialization! Meet the right people! Be energized by optimistic people! It will change your life once you make the commitment to surround yourself with positive people.
                      </p>

                      <p className="message-body">
                        At the Biotechnology Conference 2026, we will not only discuss the next Biotechnology breakthrough, but more importantly, we will discuss how to commercialize it!
                      </p>

                      <p className="message-body">I look forward to seeing everyone and sharing my story!</p>
